# Hella Collection Cells

1. Display a list using a `UICollectionView`.
2. Segues from a tapped cell to a detail view controller.

## Instructions

1. Create a `UICollectionViewController` embedded in a `UINavigationController`. Name the subclass `HellaCollectionViewController`.
2. Program the collection view to load with 100 cells, each numbered 1 through 100.
3. If the number is even the cell should be colored purple. If the number is odd the cell should be colored yellow.
3. When a cell is tapped, it should take the user to a new view controller named `HellaCollectionDetailViewController`. It should display the number passed in a label and the view's(not the label's) background color to the approproate one.
