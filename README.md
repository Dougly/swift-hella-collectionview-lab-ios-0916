1. Display a list using a `UICollectionView`.
2. Segues from a tapped cell to a detail view controller.

## Instructions

1. Drag a collection view(not a controller!) onto the existing view controller named `HellaCollectionViewController `.

2. Populate your collection view with 1000 cells.

2. <p data-visibility='hidden'>If the index of the cell is included in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number'>Fibonacci Sequence</a> , set the cell color to purple. Otherwise set it to yellow.</p>

3. When a cell is tapped, it should take the user to a new view controller named `HellaCollectionDetailViewController`. It should display the index number in a label and the view's(not the label's) background color to the approproate one.
