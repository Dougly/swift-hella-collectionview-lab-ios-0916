# Hella Collection Cells

1. Display a list using a `UICollectionView`.
2. Segues from a tapped cell to a detail view controller.

## Instructions

1. Drag a collection view(not a controller!) onto the existing view controller named `HellaCollectionViewController `.

2. Program the collection view to load with 100 cells, each numbered 1 through 100. Remember collection view cells don't have labels to add text to. You'll need to somehow add one.

3. <p data-visibility='hidden'>If the number is included in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number'>Fibonacci Sequence</a> , set the cell color to purple.</p>

3. When a cell is tapped, it should take the user to a new view controller named `HellaCollectionDetailViewController`. It should display the number passed in a label and the view's(not the label's) background color to the approproate one.
